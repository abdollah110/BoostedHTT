To make skimming over ggNtuples 6 files are needed:

Skimmer.cc (the .cc code where the skimming is defined here)
Skimmer.h (header file)
Makefile (used to compile Skimmer.cc)
InputSamples.txt  (where the list of all ggNtuples are stored, starting from /store)
Template_Submit_batch.jdl  (where condor parameters are defined. Note: you need to change the location of the runPath!!)
Template_Submit_run.sh   (instruct condor how to run the jobs)
makeSubmissionPackage.py (you need to run this file with the appropriate argument to create .sh and .jdl files for condor submission)

—————————————————————————————————————————————————
No need to do it for current round of ggNtuple
—————————————————————————————————————————————————
Skimmer.h needs to get updated whenever there is a change in the definition of the tress in the ggNtuples (some changes might be foreseen in Skimmer.cc as well)
To get the proper Skimmer.h one needs to run the latest ggNtuple on a test sample and save the output with ggtree_mc.root.

root -l ggtree_mc.root
TFile *_file0 = TFile::Open("ggtree_mc.root")
_file0->cd(“ggNtuplizer”)
EventTree->MakeClass(“Class”)

The last command generates Class.h and Class.cc from TTree: EventTree

Now all needed is to copy and paste 4 pieces from Class.h in the Skimmer.h

 // Declaration of leaf types
 // List of branches
 // Set object pointer
 // Set branch addresses and branch pointers

Now check the Skimmer.C and decide which branches you want to save in the skimming ntuple and which to drop

Steps to skim the ggNtuple:
1) Update the .cc file and add your filtering skim
2) Compile the .cc file (just type make)
3) List all samples you intend to make skim (from /store/.... )
4) run the makeSubmissionPackage.py  script:
	########
	python makeSubmissionPackage.py -x SkimerBoost_mt -i InputSample.txt -n muTau_v1 -o /store/user/abdollah/NewSkimBoost/mt/v1
	########

More info about condor is here: http://www.uscms.org/uscms_at_work/computing/setup/batch_systems.shtml#condor_1

at the end you have to hadd the root files:

1) update the had_skim.py
2) python had_skim.py
